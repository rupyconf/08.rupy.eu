<strong>Title:</strong> Correlations and Conclusions<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
Learning to properly measure and improve your applications is a universal skill that every programmer needs no matter what language they use.  This presentation will give you a good crash course in how to systematically yet simply analyze the performance of any web application, and from there learn on your own how to analyze other topics of interest.  No Ruby or Python will be used in the making of  this presentation.
<br>
<strong>Bio:</strong><br>
Zed A. Shaw is a language enthusiast who has worked for years in both
Ruby and Python professionally and as a hobby.  He currently works as a
Vice President in the financial industry where he leads a team of

<strong>Title:</strong> Business Natural Languages<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
Since the introduction of computers to the general workforce businesses have searched for a solution that will enable subject matter experts to specify the business logic of an application. This solution is highly sought after since it will allow the application to be changed without the assistance of a programmer. Programmers are still required to create the application; however, the application is written in a way that empowers the subject matter experts to maintain the business logic.<br>
Enabling the subject matter expert greatly increases efficiency of maintaining an application as the needs of the business change. Using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) is the most recent solution to this problem. A Business Natural Language is a Domain Specific Language; however, not all Domain Specific Languages are Business Natural Languages. Business Natural Languages use natural language to represent business logic. Business Natural Languages are expressed as descriptive and maintainable phrases. For example, a marketing executive for an airline could specify point award descriptions as: award 1 point for each mile flown where the total flight length is greater than 500 miles and award 500 points for each flight where the total flight length is less than or equal to 500 miles. Any domain expert, with no explanation required, can read a well-written Business Natural Language as if it were simply a phrase specifying logic. The previous airline example appears to be a specification written by a business analyst. The specification could be used to describe business logic to be implemented in a general-purpose language. However, when using a Business Natural Language the above example is a specification, but also much more. The above example is executable code, which will be used to determine point allocation after each flight flown. The above example is also documentation of the business rules contained in the point allocation application. And, the above example can be used to formulate a test case to verify the system works as expected. Business Natural Languages allow you to specify, in one location, exactly how your application should work.
<br>

Jay Fields is a software developer at ThoughtWorks. He is a early adopter who is constantly looking for new exciting technologies. His most recent work has been in the Domain Specific Language space where he delivered applications that empowered subject matter experts to write the business rules of the applications.

<strong>Title:</strong> Programming the Browser with IronPython and Silverlight<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
Silverlight is Microsoft's new browser plugin for games and rich
internet applications. Version 1.1 includes a cut down version of the
.NET framework and can be programmed in any of the languages that run on
the Dynamic Language Runtime.
<br>
This means Managed Javascript, IronRuby and IronPython can be used to do
client side browser programming.
<br>
The talk will go through creating a simple IronPython and Silverlight
application and show language interoperability between C#, IronPython
and some of the other DLR languages.<br>
It will explore the Silverlight APIs (accessing server resources, using
local storage, loading XAML for animations and the user interface) and
also interacting with the browser DOM/traditional Javascript for
creating Rich Internet Applications.
<br>
<strong>Bio:</strong><br>
I have been a Python developer for four years and have been
working for a young startup in London for the last eighteen months,

<strong>Title:</strong> How to write “pythonic” code<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
Knowing the syntax and the standard library of Python alone doesn't make one a
good Python programmer. In more than a decade of increasing usage and
popularity of the language, Pythonistas have developed many typical Python
idioms and pythonic ways "to do it". These are either based on the fact that
in Python, being a highly dynamic language, many things necessary in more
static languages just make no sense or on the fundamental principles laid down
in the so-called "Zen of Python".
<br>
For the (Python or programming) novice, this talks tries to explain those
principles and how they translate into actual code. For the seasoned developer,
maybe coming from other languages, the talk shows how everyday problems and
common constructs are coded in Python and how your code can achieve the
(sometimes elusive) quality of being "pythonic". For both groups, the talk
delivers a cookbook of programming recipies, that every developer can use in
his programs and which have proven to work well for Python developers in general.

<strong>Title:</strong> Test-Driven Development in Python – getting started<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong>
A step-by-step illustration of creating a test-driven project from
scratch, using Python's built-in unittest module, including:
<ul>
<li>creation of acceptance tests from the specification,</li>
<li>creation of unit tests before coding,</li>
<li>a live debugging session, driven by failing tests.</li>
</ul>
Emphasis is placed on the higher-level implications of TDD, such as:
<ul>
<li>refactoring,</li>
<li>integration of tests into the project build process,</li>
<li>the benefits from letting tests <strong>drive</strong> your process, rather than
merely creating tests for your code,</li>
<li>the drawbacks of TDD as well as the advantages.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Title:</strong> Is Rails as agile as advertise<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
Rails as Agile as advertised? This is what the speaker will demonstrate in this session.
In the 3 hours session, the speaker will start an IMDB-like Rails project from scratch and build it from the bottom up until it's in a launchable state, at least for a public beta.<br>
The speaker will present all Rails best practices like fat-models/skinny-controllers, high test coverage and RESTfull implementation.
<br>
The session will also include some tips and tricks for some tools that help speeding Rails development up.
<br>
The project will have some user-interactivity corners like comments, reviews, ratings and even a public user profile. Some mash-ups from other online resources may be presented too.
<br>
Everything will be built from scratch with the help of some commonly used plugins like restfull_authentications and acts_as_taggable_steroids. A ready design will be implemented using haml too. The main goal of this session is demonstrate the agility in Rails and how it really helps in executing ideas and projects.

<strong>Title:</strong> Ebb Web Server<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
<a href="http://ebb.rubyforge.org/">Ebb</a>, like Mongrel, is a bare bones server to prop up a larger
framework. Ebb is uses the new libev event library to handle incoming
requests before passing them off to a Ragel state machine for parsing.
Ebb is written entirely in C and is designed to be very fast and light. A Ruby binding makes Ebb
into a Rack handler so that it can easily host Rails, Merb, and other
Ruby language frameworks. In the future a Python WSGI binding will
also be added (hopefully by the time of RuPy!).<br>

<strong>Title:</strong> TDD in Rails<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
This talk will provide a brief overview of Test Driven Development and
Behaviour Driven Development followed by a demonstration of creating a
Rails application from scratch all the time being test/spec driven.
<br>
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development technique that
many people are aware of. However, only a small number of people
actually use it. I believe it's due to the lack of existing examples
showing how simple it is and how great it is to be "driven". TDD
affects the way you design your software. It also helps you with
gathering requirements without the need of having a big, heavy
specification. The talk will demonstrate how to prepare a user story,
split it into tasks and TDD all of them.<br>
I've been using TDD for 6 years.
<br>
Subjects covered will include:
<ul>
<li> What is TDD/BDD,</li>
<li> How to organise tests for a typical Rails application,</li>
<li> TDD/BDD as a design technique,</li>
<li> A live coding session,</li>
<li> The process of fixing a bug being test-driven,</li>
<li> The process of preparing and implementing a new user story,</li>
<li> RSpec on Rails (Stories Runner),</li>
<li> Autotest,</li>
<li> How to start doing TDD/BDD in an application that was not tested at all. </li>
</ul>
<strong>Bio:</strong><br>
Andrzej runs a company which specialises in creating Rails
applications. REST and TDD/BDD are the main design techniques used in
his projects. He mentors other Rails developers. He is also employed
with Resolver Systems writing a desktop application with IronPython.
Andrzej is a software developer with over 8 years of IT experience.
<br>
Andrzej has a <a href="http://andrzejkrzywda.com/">blog</a> which focuses on dynamic
languages and agile topics.
<br>
Andrzej has previously given the following presentations:
<ul>
<li>RuPy 2007 - Developing with IronPython and Windows Forms (including
live coding),</li>
<li>PyCon (USA) 2007 - Developing with IronPython and Windows Forms

<strong>Title:</strong> Let the Python crawl<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
We all know that the only person that can copy whole Internet to a
floppy disk is Chuck Norris. However, it would be a sin not to dump
and analyze at least some part of the World Wide Web.
<br>
This prelection is supposed to be an introduction to web crawling with
some real-life working examples. Author's experience will be shared
discussing spidering issues and tactics, possible applications (with
social reverse engineering at the top), storing data and visualizing
it. All of this with Python code in the background all the time.

<strong>Title:</strong> PyPy – status and the next goals<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
I'd like to present the status and next goals of
the PyPy project: both a platform for implementing dynamic languages
and a complete Python Interpreter written in a high level language.
PyPy translates interpreters to C, .NET and the JVM.  The talk will
focus on what is new since the last RuPy conference.  I am going to
talk about speed and feature improvements, particularly our flexible
garbage collection framework and the Just-in-time compiler generator.
This generator is used to automatically turn our Python interpreter
into a compiler for directly emitting assembler code.
<br>
<strong>Bio:</strong><br>
Carl Friedrich Bolz is one of the core developers of PyPy. He is
studying computer science at the University of Düsseldorf. Currently he
is working on his Master's thesis, which is about making PyPy as fast as
possible and proving that dynamic languages can be almost as fast as
static ones. In his spare time he plays the bassoon.

<strong>Title:</strong> Rails, Amazon Web Services and you<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
The problem of scalability can be an indicator of popularity and
success for a web application. Still, this is a problem and needs to
be addressed. Amazon offers two solutions to handle high load: Simple
Storage Service (S3) and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The presentation
will show in practice how to use these services in Ruby on Rails
applications. It will also demonstrate how existing Ruby utilities
provide an easy way to handle high load.

<strong>Title:</strong> Complicated SQL querries in Ruby on Rails applications<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
Creating simple SQL querries in Ruby on Rails is quite trivial. However sometimes there is a need to retrieve the information more complicated then that stored directly in the rows of one or a few tables, or we have a problem with excessive databse load caused by our application. How to deal with that? The talk attempts to answer this question by explaining the way of creating complicated SQL querries in accordance with Rails philosophy, showing practical appliances and presenting optimization methods.

<strong>Title:</strong> Metaprogramming - an adventure in doing magic with Ruby <br>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
Metaprogramming is the act of writing programs that generate or
manipulate other programs. This introduction to meta-programming using
Ruby starts with an overview of Ruby's object system, as it is the
basis for many metaprogramming techniques described further in the
talk. Than, the fundamental patterns for generating code with Ruby are
described, together with examples of how popular projects use them to
abstract certain problem domains. In the end, more advanced topics are
discussed in the context of metaprogramming, like creating Domain
Specific Languages or parsing small external languages.

<strong>Title:</strong> Why It's Good To Be Lazy<br>
<strong>Summary:</strong><br>
When we learn how to program we are told that an algorithm is a
sequence of steps to be realized by the computer, leading to an
expected result. This imperative approach is the most popular point of
view on programming, and the Turning machine is a well-known model for
it. But there is another approach, claiming that a program consists
purely of stateless evaluations of expressions, where the exact order
of evaluation is not defined. This approach is called functional
programming, and the lambda calculus defines a mathematical foundation
for it. I will speak on what are the benefits of functional
programming and how to leverage functional features present in both
Python and Ruby.
